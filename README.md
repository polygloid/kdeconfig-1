greetings
this is how to do the thing
this is my first time using github for my own things
so if it sucks
thats why

STEPS:
1. install latte dock from https://github.com/KDE/latte-dock
2. install plasmoids
3. install font from https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/sf-pro-display
4. install the latte theme i have here
5. add plasmoids to Home/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids
6. open latte dock, right click the dock, and click on layouts
7. press "Import" on it and add the layout
OPTIONAL: install my wallpaper if you want the menubar to be fully black, you can edit it and switch the image to whatever you want and keep the black bar

it should work from here
if the font is broken just set it as the default in settings and make it bold in the inline clock
if global menu is broken on konsole try CTRL+SHIFT+M and restart
if the clock format isnt the same as mine set it as "Custom Date" and make it "ddd d"
